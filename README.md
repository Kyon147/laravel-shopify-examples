# Laravel Shopify Examples
A collection of different templates for the Laravel Shopify package which you can [view here](https://github.com/Kyon147/laravel-shopify)

## VueJS

## React

## Interia

## Blade
This is the "default" set up, but is slowly becoming harder to get approaval on the Shopify app store so is not going to be included in this repo. 

# Contributing to the examples

Please make sure that each framework is in it's own folder within this repo.

The example must be a working laravel shopify app before it is merged into this repo. This is to make sure other users can see how a full app can be set up and should be **barebones** i.e. it should not have business logic, only what is needed to get the app up and running as a minimum.

One you are happy with your example, please submit a PR.
